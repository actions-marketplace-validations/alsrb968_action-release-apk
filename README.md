ðŸ•· Build and Publish release APK when your push a new tag

## Usage

To use the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and provide the required Secrets and Environment variables.

#### YML
```
name: Publish Release APK

on:
  push:
    tags: [ "*" ]

jobs:
  publish:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: gradle

    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew
    - name: Build Release APK
      run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
    - name: Publish APK
      uses: alsrb968/action-release-apk@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
        APP_FOLDER: app
```

### Secrets

You'll need to provide this secret token to use the action (for publishing the APK). Enter these secrets in your Settings > Secrets

* **TOKEN**: Create a new [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` access.

I am unsure as to why using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided universally will fail to authorize the user. This is the only workaround that I'd found.

### Environment Variables

You'll need to provide these environment variables to specify exactly what information is needed to build the APK.

* **APP_FOLDER**: main folder to search for the apk. Most of the time, it's `app`
